# ssostreamit
I struggled a little bit when writing some code to SSO with streamlit. Here is some sample code that would help anyone new to enabling streamlit with Azure AD.
MSAL is the Queen here. Therefore all thanks to MSAL

# requirements
Install requirements in python file to get started.

# how to run
This sample requires some environment variables so make sure that is defined.
For example on my mac i define this env variables for example export clientid="xxxxxx"

streamlit run app/Login.py
