# ssostreamit
I encountered challenges while enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) with Streamlit. Below, Iâ€™ve provided sample code that can assist newcomers in setting up SSO with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) is the queen here, and I owe my gratitude to the MSAL library. But hope this helps someone new to streamlit

# requirements
Install requirements in python file to get started.

# how to run
This sample requires some environment variables so make sure that is defined.
For example on my mac i define this env variables for example export clientid="xxxxxx"

streamlit run app/Login.py
